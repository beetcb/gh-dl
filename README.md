# ghdl

> Memorize `ghdl` as `github download`

`ghdl` is a fast and simple program (and also a golang module) for downloading and installing executable binary from github releases.

# Features

- Auto decompressing and unarchiving the downloaded asset (without any system dependencies like `tar` or `unzip`).

    ```ts
    Currently supporting unarchiving `tar` and decompressing `zip` `gzip`.
    Package format `deb` `rpm` `apk` will be downloaded directly
    ```
- Setups for executable: `ghdl` moves executable to specified location and add execute permissions to the file.
- Auto filtering: multiple assets in one release will be filtered by OS or ARCH. This feature can be disabled using `-F` flag.
- Interactive TUI: when auto filtering is failed or returned multiple options, you can select assets in a interactive way, with vim key bindings support.
- Release tags: `ghdl` downloads latest release by default, other or old tagged releases can be downloaded by specifying release tag: `username/repo#tagname`
- Inspect download status with real-time progress bar.

# Installation

> If you're going to use `ghdl` as a go module, ignore the following installation progress.

- Using Go tools: 

    go will download the latest version of ghdl to $GOPATH/bin, please make sure $GOPATH is in the PATH: 

    ```sh
    go install github.com/beetcb/ghdl/ghdl@latest
    ```

- Download and run executable from release.
- Run the following shell script(*nix system only):

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL "https://bina.egoist.sh/beetcb/ghdl?dir=/usr/local/bin" | sh
    # feel free to change the `dir` url param to specify the installation directory.
    ```

# Usage

### CLI

Run `ghdl --help`

```sh
‚ùØ ghdl --help

ghdl download binary from github release
ghdl handles archived or compressed file as well

Usage:
  ghdl <user/repo[#tagname]> [flags]

Flags:
  -F, --filter-off    turn off auto-filtering feature
  -h, --help          help for ghdl
  -n, --name string   specify binary file name to enhance filtering and extracting accuracy
  -p, --path path     save binary to path and add execute permission to it (default ".")
```

It's tedious to specify `-p` manually, we can alias `ghdl -p "$DirInPath"` to a shorthand command, then use it as a executable installer.

### Go Module

1. Require `ghdl` to go.mod

	```sh
	go get github.com/beetcb/ghdl
	```

2. Use `ghdl`'s out-of-box utilities: see [TestDownloadFdBinary func](./ghdl_test.go) as an example
